        <h1>Role in the Rebellion</h1>
        <p>Cassian Andor was a captain of the Rebellion mainly operating in the Alliance Intelligence sector. He was entrusted with infiltrating Imperial bases and stealing intelligence and experimental weaponry/equipment from the Empire. Taking on many aliases during his time, his work culminated in the theft of the Death Star plans in Scariff, which allowed the Rebel Alliance to destroy it, kickstarting the fall of the Empire.</p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <section>
                <p>Cassian was born in Kenari, going by the name of Kassa. His planet’s environment was permanently damaged in a fuel mining disaster, killing his younger sister (allegedly) along with the rest of the remaining Kenari population. He was rescued by his eventual foster parents, Marva and Clem Andor, before the mining accident killed the Kenari people, sparing him from the mass killing. He spent the rest of his childhood, teenage years, and early adulthood living in Ferrix, being raised by Clem and Marva, changing his name to Cassian Andor.</p>

            <h2>Ghorman Massacre and the Death Star</h2>
            <section>
                <p>Cassian was a witness to the infamous
Ghorman Massacre while participating in an operation where he was to
assassinate high ranking ISB officer Dedra Meero. He was unsuccessful because
unbeknownst to him, the Empire was leading a false flag operation at that
exact moment, where an Imperial official would shoot one of his own
Stormtroopers, blame it on a Ghorman protestor, and use it as an excuse to
open fire and murder the protestors. Emperor Palpatine was intending on
killing the Ghorman’s in order to mine a material that was to be used for the
construction of the Death Star. A year after the massacre, Cassian was
informed of the true nature of the Empire’s plan, and went on a suicide
mission to steal the plans of the Death Star for the rebellion. He was
successful and gave the rebellion a fighting chance in the war, but
sacrificed his own life in the process. Cassian was killed on Scariff by the
Death Star in the year 1 BBY at the age of 32.</p>
