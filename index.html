        <h1>Role in the Rebellion</h1>
        <p>
            Cassian Andor was a captain of the Rebellion mainly operating in the Alliance Intelligence sector. 
            He was entrusted with infiltrating Imperial bases and stealing intelligence and experimental 
            weaponry/equipment from the Empire. Taking on many aliases during his time, his work culminated 
            in the theft of the Death Star plans in Scariff, which allowed the Rebel Alliance to destroy it, 
            kickstarting the fall of the Empire.

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Cassian was born in Kenari, going by the name of <strong>Kassa</strong>. His planet’s environment 
                    was permanently damaged in a fuel mining disaster, killing his younger sister (allegedly) along 
                    with the rest of the remaining Kenari population. He was rescued by his eventual foster parents, 
                    Marva and Clem Andor, before the mining accident killed the Kenari people, sparing him from the 
                    mass killing. He spent the rest of his childhood, teenage years, and early adulthood living in 
                    Ferrix, being raised by Clem and Marva, changing his name to Cassian Andor.

            <h2>Ghorman Massacre and the Death Star</h2>
            <section>
                <p>
                    Cassian was a witness to the infamous Ghorman Massacre while participating in an operation 
                    where he was to assassinate high ranking ISB officer Dedra Meero. He was unsuccessful because 
                    unbeknownst to him, the Empire was leading a false flag operation at that exact moment, where 
                    an Imperial official would shoot one of his own Stormtroopers, blame it on a Ghorman protestor, 
                    and use it as an excuse to open fire and murder the protestors. Emperor <em>Palpatine</em> was 
                    intending on killing the Ghorman’s in order to mine a material that was to be used for the 
                    construction of the Death Star. A year after the massacre, Cassian was informed of the true 
                    nature of the Empire’s plan, and went on a suicide mission to steal the plans of the Death Star 
                    for the rebellion. He was successful and gave the rebellion a fighting chance in the war, but 
                    sacrificed his own life in the process. Cassian was killed on Scariff by the Death Star in the 
                    year 1 BBY at the age of 32.
